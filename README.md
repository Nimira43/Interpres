# Interpres

Interpres is a lightweight, browser‑based translation and speech application built with vanilla JavaScript, the Google Translate API, the Web Speech API, TailwindCSS, and deployed on Vercel.

It allows users to:

- Translate text into multiple languages
- Select from available system voices
- Play translated text using speech synthesis
- Run entirely in the browser with a simple UI

This project was created as a compact, fast, and accessible translation tool with no frameworks and minimal dependencies.
